# Introduction

In the analyses here: https://xsun1229.github.io/CarT/data.html , we have noticed that if we filter out the variants annotated as 'LOWCONF', we'll miss many variants.

The LOWCONF filter, is applied to variants where no genotype has a posterior probability (GP) greater than 0.9 (MAX(FORMAT/GP)>0.9). 

So we'll relax the threshold to allow for more uncertainty and see if we can secure more variants.

We followed the steps below 

- Apply MAF filter and genotype probability filter in one step, then save to a new file

`bcftools view -i 'INFO/AF >= 0.01 && INFO/AF <= 0.99' af.recomp.vcf.gz | bcftools filter -i 'MAX(FORMAT/GP) > 0.8' -Oz -o GP08.MAF001.filtered.vcf.gz`

- Restrict to autosomes

`bcftools index GP08.MAF001.filtered.vcf.gz`
`bcftools view -r 1-22 GP08.MAF001.filtered.vcf.gz -Oz -o GP08.MAF001.autosomes.vcf.gz`



```{r}

```
