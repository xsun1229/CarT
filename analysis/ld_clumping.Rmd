# Introduction

- **The gwas data is shared by Salem**: There are 46,326 variants significantly associated with T1D at the GWAS significance threshold (5^10-8) from Chiou J et al 2021 (PMID: 34012112) T1D study contains. Out of those, there are 35,286 matching between Chiou J et al study and our CAR T-cell study. Salem extracted them from our CAR T-cell dataset and ran allele association analysis. The summary statistics is the results of this allele association analysis that shows the variants associated with T1D in the Chiou J et al study and found to be also associated with CAR T-cell response in our dataset.

- **LD reference pannel** : 1000G EUR, 503 samples

- **Plink LD clumping setting**: 

```
plink --bfile /project/xinhe/xsun/data/1kg/1000G_EUR_phase3_autosomes \
      --clump gwas/gwas_for_ldclumping.txt \
      --clump-p1 0.01  Defines the primary significance threshold for index SNPs, usually 5e-8
      --clump-p2 0.1  Defines the secondary threshold for nearby SNPs.
      --clump-r2 0.1  Sets the LD threshold (SNPs with r2 > 0.1 will be clumped).
      --clump-kb 250  Sets the window size around index SNPs (250 kb).
      --out clumped_results/clumped_results  
```

# Results

```{r}

clump_res <- read.table("/project/xinhe/xsun/cart/2.ldclumping/clumped_results/clumped_results.clumped", header = T)
clump_res <- clump_res[,-12]

clump_res <- clump_res[order(clump_res$CHR,clump_res$BP),]

DT::datatable(clump_res,caption = htmltools::tags$caption( style = 'caption-side: left; text-align: left; color:black;  font-size:150% ;','Lead snps after LD clumping'),options = list(pageLength = 10) )

```

```
CHR	Chromosome number of the index SNP.
F	Number of clumps formed (always 1 per row, since each row is an index SNP).
SNP	Index SNP (lead SNP) selected for the clump.
BP	Base pair position of the index SNP.
P	P-value of the index SNP from GWAS.
TOTAL	Total number of SNPs in the clump (including the index SNP).
NSIG	Number of SNPs in the clump with a P-value below --clump-p2 threshold.
S05, S01, S001, S0001	Number of SNPs in the clump with P-values below 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001, respectively.
